# FMGAD
Students such as I study the optional discrete component of the OCR A Further Mathematics A-Level. One of the topics in this component is graph theory, which includes several algorithms that can be executed on weighted graphs, including:
* Dijkstra’s algorithm
* Prim’s algorithm (also known as Jarník's algorithm)
* Kruskal’s algorithm
* Solving the Chinese postman problem (also known as the route inspection problem)
* Nearest Neighbour algorithm
* Finding lower bounds for the Travelling salesman problem.
 
Thus, this project was created as an educational tool for teaching these algorithms graphically, by tracing them and/or solving them where appropriate. There are many possible users for such a tool, including:
* Private candidates such as self-taught and/or home-schooled students. They may not have access to the same resources, or whoever is home-schooling them may not be familiar with the material themselves. 
* Students struggling with homework questions.
* Teachers who want their students to be more engaged with the topic and who are open to using it in lesson.
